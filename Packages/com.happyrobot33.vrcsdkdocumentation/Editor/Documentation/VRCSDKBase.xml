                'mute' the player.

            <summary>
                A player's voice is normally simulated to
                be a point source, however changing this value allows the source to appear to come
                from a larger area.
            </summary>
            <remarks> This should be used carefully, and is mainly for distant audio sources that
                need to sound "large" as you move past them. Keep this at zero unless you know what
                you're doing. If you want a user's voice to sound like it is close no matter how far
                it is, increase the Voice Distance Near range to a large value. <br /> Checkout the <see

            <summary>
                Disables the low-pass filter on the player's voice.
            </summary>
            <remarks> When a voice is some distance off, it is passed through a low-pass filter to
                help with understanding noisy worlds. You can disable this if you want to skip this
                filter. For example, if you intend for a player to use their voice channel to play a
                high-quality DJ mix, turning this filter off is advisable. <br /> Checkout the <see
