        <summary>
            Gets the rotation of the specified Bone in the Player's Avatar, or Quaternion.Identity
            (0,0,0,1) if the bone does not exist.
        </summary>
        <remarks> Warning! This information can be frustrum-culled on remote players and may not be
            accurate if the local player cannot see the remote player. Note that Avatars may not
            have all the same bones in the places you expect, so be careful making assumptions about
            attributes like a player's height, pose etc based on the rotation of bones. Things like
            wrist rotation, or forward axis's of a hand have no set standard, so for one avatar it
            may be +X, for another it may be -Z. The only reliable rotation is from <see
                cref="VRC.SDKBase.VRCPlayerApi.GetTrackingData(VRC.SDKBase.VRCPlayerApi.TrackingDataType)"></see>,
            however this only works on local players, so may require a more complex setup depending
            on your application.</remarks>

        <summary>
            Gets a struct called TrackingData, which contains separate Position and Rotation data.
        </summary>
        <remarks> Warning! This information can be frustrum-culled on remote players and may not be
            accurate if the local player cannot see the remote player. This is the suggested way to
            get position and rotation data for a Player's head
            and hands. This returns data from the TrackingManager for a Local Player (ie the data
            coming from their headset / trackers) and from the RightHand, LeftHand and Head bones
            for a Remote Player. Origin returns the center of the local VR user's playspace, while
            returning the player's position for local Desktop users and all remote users. AvatarRoot
            returns data for the root transform of the avatar (the same transform that the player
            capsule is attached to). For users in Fully-Body Tracking, AvatarRoot will not rotate
            with the head facing direction. If you need data reflecting the general forward facing
            direction of a Player, consider using GetRotation instead.</remarks>

        <returns>
            The tracking data for the specified type. IMPORTANT WARNING: The returned tracking data
            will contain bone position/rotation
            if used on remote players when asking for things like controller position! The tracking
            data is only correct if used on the local player.
