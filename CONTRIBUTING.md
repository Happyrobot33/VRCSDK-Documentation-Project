In general, the existing XML documentation is a good example of how to write new documentation. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when writing new documentation, that might not be immediately obvious.

# Understanding the File Structure
XML documentation is written a little different to how it normally would be done if these were generated by MSBuild. Inside the `Documentation` folder, each assembly will have its own folder defined for it. The name of this folder is important! its how the injector knows where to put the final documentation XML, so make sure it matches the assembly you are working for, including case! Inside each of the folders, You can create as many XML files as you would like, they will all be merged at pre-processing time. It is recommended however that you follow a standard, in this case, each XML file in a assembly folder is named after the class that it documents, for example `VRCPlayerApi.xml` only documents the VRCPlayerApi class.

# Custom XML tags
## <docURL>
This tag is used to specify the URL of the documentation for the current file. It is used in the following format:
```xml
<docURL>URL TO DOCUMENTATION</docURL>
```

The injector script will format this accordingly when it pre-processes the XML file. The injector will throw a warning if this tag is missing, so it should be included on all documented members.

# Useful resources
General guidelines on the different normal tags that C# XML documentation uses can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/).
One very important resource to actually writing the XML manually is [This documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments#d42-id-string-format). This covers the different member types and general formatting of the XML files themselves.
